# READ ME #

During this project, I refactored the HTML and CSS code given to me by doing the following:



    1. Changing all the <div> tags to more specific semantic HTML elements.
    2. Combining common elements in CSS for better readability and condensing the file.
    3. Added <figcaption> to all images for accessibility and added CSS factors to correspond with the <figcaptions> so they would sit below the the associated image.
    4. Added commentary to the CSS file.
    5. Added a README file to highlight my procress.
